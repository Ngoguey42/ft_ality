- page 3 : You will implement, train and run an automaton to recognise such moves from the list of key combinations
- page 3 : in the same way words are made with symbols, combos are made with keys
- page 3 : you will recreate a fighting gameâ€™s training mode

- page 8 : Your automaton will be built at runtime, using grammar files that contain the moves to be learnt by the automaton
- page 8 : The file path of one grammar will be given in command line arguments.
- page 8 : you have to do is split (i.e. tokenize) your rule to get a list of tokens, and then give it to the automaton which will generate transitions for each token in succession.
